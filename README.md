## Project Objective:
Develop a classification model to identify whether a customer is happy or not from a data with hundreds of anonymized features. The task is to predict the probability that each customer in the test set is an unsatisfied customer.

## About Data:
1. train.csv - the training set including the target
2. test.csv - the test set without the target

## Learning Objectives and methodology:
1. Understand Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) and apply various EDA methods on the data
2. Build a predictive model using Decision Tree Classifier by changing various parameters
3. Utilize data visualization libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib
